      $$USER
      This is the name that a report query expression is saved with.
      Any name up to 20 characters long may be specified for the name.
      
      Normally the name reflects the owner (ie: creator) of the expression
      and some indictaion as to what information the expression selects.
      
      For example, if an expression created by Ian Smith that extracted a
      list of all customers with credit limits of more than $100,000 was
      to be saved, a name like "IS HIGH CREDIT LIMIT" might be a good choice.
