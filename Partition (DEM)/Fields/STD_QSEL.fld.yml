      This is the standard field used to input a selection (before grouping)
      expression that will ultimately be passed to the IBM supplied OPNQRYF
      (Open Query File) command.
      
      To select all information specify *ALL (in UPPERCASE) as the selection
      expression you wish to use. Use this option with some care because it
      may cause very large amounts of output and/or computer resource to be
      used to process all the information.
      
      Otherwise an expression can be input using the names of fields from
      the data base. Some examples of expressions involving alphanumeric and
      straight numeric fields follow :
      
         CUSTNO = 12345  <numeric customer number>
         CUSTNO = "12345" <alphanumeric customer number>
         CUSNAME *CT "BL" <customer name contains string "BL">
         (DATE *GE 911001) *AND (DATE *LE 911031) <date is in October, 1991)
         (PMONTH = 10) *AND (PYEAR = 1991) <the month of October, 1991)
      
      where CUSTNO, CUSNAME, DATE, PMONTH and PYEAR are the names assigned
      to the elements in some example data base file. They are unlikely to
      represent names that you should actually use in your expressions.
      
      An expression up to 256 characters long may be specified.
      
      For more information about this facility you should refer to the
      QRYSLT (Query Selection Expression) parameter of the IBM supplied
      OPNQRYF (Open Query File) command.
