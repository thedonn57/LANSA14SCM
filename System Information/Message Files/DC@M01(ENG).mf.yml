      Second Level Text:  An incompatibilty exists between user parameter "&1" and the context it is being used in. This error most commonly occurs when user parameter "&1" is numeric and it is being used in an alphanumeric context, or when user parameter "&1" is alphanumeric and it is being used in a numeric context. Check the definition of user parameter "&1" (by using the option on the process definition menu) and compare this with the context it is being used in.

      Second Level Text:  A user parameter can only be referenced within a process definition since user parameters are only defined within a process. This error has probably arisen because you have tried to reference a user parameter in a context in which it does not "exist". For instance a user parameter cannot be used in a FILE level validation check, because user parameters only "exist" within a process and have nothing to do with file definitions. Remove the reference to user parameter "&1".

      Second Level Text:  A field name can be from 1 to 9 characters in length. However, the maximum recommended length is 6 characters if the field is to be defined within a file. This ensures that the fields in the file will be acceptable to any RPG application programs you may choose to write outside the LANSA system. The restriction to 9 characters (or less) exists because the RDML language requires fields in programs be prefixed by a "#" (hash) symbol. &N If this message occurs when making an "OTHER" file known to LANSA, it means that the field will be "invisible" to RDML programs that use the file. However, by using the virtual field facility the field can be made "visible" again via a valid 9 (or less) character virtual field name. Refer to your product vendor for further advice on how this is done.

At any time the task/activity that you were performing before using the attention key can be resumed by pressing using function key &1. Note also that some entries on the field, file, process or housekeeping menus may be displayed with a message indicating they are "Suspended or N/A". This indicates that they cannot be effectively used in conjunction with the activity that is currently suspended (usually because program recursion would occur). If you select one of these "Suspended or N/A" entries your suspended activity will be immediately resumed just as if you had used function key &1.

This is because the AS/400 is only "upward" compatible for objects. In the case of a PC export the transfer of the object is not relevant.

      First Level Text:   Attempt to gain exclusive system lock for internal reorganise failed
      Second Level Text:  A LANSA internal data base reorganisation was started, but it could not gain an exclusive lock on the LANSA system. This means that other jobs/users in the system are currently accessing the system, or have accessed the system and exited leaving files still open. In either case, an internal reorganise cannot proceed until it has exclusive use of the entire internal data base. Review the object locks (use WRKOBJLCK or DSPOBJLCK commands) on data area DC@A01 in the LANSA program library to determine current users of LANSA. Review the object locks on file DC@F02 in the LANSA data library to determine current users and past users who have files still open. Past users may close open files by signing off or using the RCLRSC command. When no locks show against either of these objects attempt this operation again.

  - LMD0032:
      First Level Text:   Relationship with these keys already defined to the same entity.
      Second Level Text:  All of the keys on this relationship are already included in the entity because another relationship already exists to the same entity. If there are really two relationships to the same entity, then at least one of the keys must be included twice rather than being shared (i.e. it must be possible to achieve two unique key settings).

  - LMD0033:
      First Level Text:   WARNING - Alias element has no associated physical field.
      Second Level Text:  This element has an alias specified, for which no physical details have been specified. The physical field associated with this element would normally reference the physical field associated with the alias, but in this case, it will not. In order to allow the reference, physical details must be specified for the alias.

  - LMD0034:
      First Level Text:   Physical field name must be specified.

      First Level Text:   Mismatch for working list &1 - entry length or number of entries received
      Second Level Text:  You have passed a working list (argument or return value) to this built-in function. However there either an aggregate entry length mismatch or maximum number of entries passed is greater than the maximum number of entries defined in the built-in function. The aggregate entry length is the sum of the byte lengths of all fields defined in the list. Either error implies that the built-in function has been changed so that it is not backwards compatible. Change the function using this built-in function.
