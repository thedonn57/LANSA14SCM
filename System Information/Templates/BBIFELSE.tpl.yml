         This application template constructs an simple IF / ELSE/ ENDIF construct into 
         your RDML program. If you use it you will be asked 2 questions .....           
                                                                                        
         1. To specify a comment about what the IF command tests for. Your reply should 
            be brief and concise. For example : "Customer is over the credit limit".    
                                                                                        
         2. To specify the actual condition that is to be tested by the IF command.     
            Construct your condition according to the rules defined in the Technical    
            Guide. Do NOT surround the condition with quotes. Some examples are :       
                                                                                        
            #AMOUNT *GT #CRDLMT  --> amount spent is greater than credit limit)         
                                                                                        
            #CUSTYPE = A --> customer type is an A                                      
                                                                                        
            (#CUSTYPE = A) *AND (#AMOUNT *GT #CRDLMT) --> customer type is an A and     
                                           amount spent is greater than credit limit    
                                                                                        
            ((#A * #B) - #C) *GT 24.56   --> A times B minus C is greater than 24.56
