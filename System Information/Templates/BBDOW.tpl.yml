         This application template constructs a simple DOWHILE / ENDWHILE contruct into 
         your RDML program. If you use it you will be asked 2 questions .....           
                                                                                        
         1. To specify a comment about what the DOWHILE command tests for. Your reply   
            should be brief and concise. (eg: "Do while errors exist in data").         
                                                                                        
         2. To specify the actual condition that is to be tested by the DOWHILE command.
            Construct your condition according to the rules defined in the Technical    
            Guide. Do NOT surround the condition with quotes. Some examples are :       
                                                                                        
            #ERRORS *GT 0 ---------> errors exist in input data                         
                                                                                        
            #CUSTYPE = A --> customer type is an A                                      
                                                                                        
            (#CUSTYPE = A) *AND (#AMOUNT *GT #CRDLMT) --> customer type is an A and     
                                           amount spent is greater than credit limit    
                                                                                        
            ((#A * #B) - #C) *GT 24.56   --> A times B minus C is greater than 24.56
