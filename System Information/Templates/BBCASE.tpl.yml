         This application template constructs an CASE/WHEN/OTHERWISE/ENDCASE construct  
         into your RDML program. Initially you will be asked 3 questions ....           
                                                                                        
         1. To specify a description of what the CASE construct does. This is used to   
            generate a comment into your RDML program. If you do not specify a value    
            no comment will be generated. Be brief and concise (eg: "Handle each        
            individual customer type separately").                                      
                                                                                        
         2. To nominate the actual field that is to be tested by the CASE construct.    
            Precede the field name with a "#" sign like you do in all RDML programs.    
            (eg: #CUSTYP is the name of the customner type field). You must nominate    
            a valid field name.                                                         
                                                                                        
         3. To specify how many separate conditions are to be tested by the CASE        
            construct. The answer must be a number in the range 1 - 20. In the example  
            being used here, you might what to individually test the "Customer type"    
            for values A, S, V and P, so you would reply 4 to this question.

         After specifying how many separate conditions are to be tested, you will then  
         be asked the same question repetetively. This question asks you to specify a   
         value that is to be compared with the field previously nominated.              
                                                                                        
         In the example being used, 4 separate conditions were to be tested, so the     
         same question would be asked 4 times.                                          
                                                                                        
                      On the first  occurence you would answer A                        
                       "  "  second     "      "    "     "    S                        
                       "  "  third      "      "    "     "    V                        
                       "  "  fourth     "      "    "     "    P                        
                                                                                        
         About field types : In the example given it is assumed that field #CUSTYP is   
         alphanumeric. Note that all the comparison values are also alphanumeric, so    
         the generated RDML code should work just fine. However, if field #CUSTYP was   
         still alphanumeric, but the comparison values were 1,2,3 and 4, you should     
         surround the value with 2 single quotes to ensure that the RDML compiler       
         understands that it is using an alphanumeric '2', rather than the number 2.    
         Example replies in this case would be ''1'', ''2'', ''3'', and ''4''.
